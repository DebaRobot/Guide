                  <h2>Why Increase in Frauds ??</h2>
                  <p>The myriads of plastic cards in use worldwide are a gold mine for criminals. By 2027, financial service providers are
                    expected to take a $40 billion hit globally in credit card losses, a significant increase compared to $27.85 bn in 2018.
                    This growth in losses is partially caused by the rise of electronic transactions. Just imagine that today the average 
                    American has more than three credit cards, which amounts to 1.5 billion cards in the US alone. While the number of plastic
                    cards globally numbers an impressive 22.11 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reason is that fraudulent methods are getting more sophisticated and thus harder to spot by traditional fraud detection
                    software.To address such a massive challenge effectively, companies involved in the card payment process need advanced approaches.
